What Is the Change Event, and How Does It Work?
-----------------------------------------------

The `change` event is a special event which is fired when the user modifies the value of certain input elements. More specifically:

*   When a checkbox is ticked or unticked.

*   When a radio button is ticked.

*   When the user makes a selection from something like a date picker or dropdown menu.

*   When an input loses focus (the user tabs to the next field, or clicks out of the form) after the user has changed the value.

*   When the user otherwise confirms the value, such as by hitting enter after typing some text.

Note that the `change` event does NOT fire when your user types in an input. The `change` event will only fire after they have focused on another element.

Here is an example of using the `change` event with a dropdown menu:

```
<select id="select-menu">
  <option value="option1">Option 1</option>
  <option value="option2">Option 2</option>
  <option value="option3">Option 3</option>
</select>
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

```
const selectMenu = document.getElementById("select-menu");
selectMenu.addEventListener("change", (event) => {
  console.log(`You selected: ${event.target.value}`);
});
```

Each time the user selects a different option from the dropdown menu, the `change` event will fire, and the selected value will be logged to the console.

The `change` event still generates an `Event` object, but unlike most other events it does not generate a custom implementation – the only properties and methods you will have access to are those on the base `Event` object.

This differs from the `input` event, which generates a dedicated `InputEvent` object. The change event also differs in a few ways. An `input` event WILL trigger when a user types content into a field, for example.

These differences are important to remember, as you might get tripped up by the timing of these events firing.

- Typing text into an input field without leaving it.
- Ticking a checkbox.
- Selecting a date from a date picker.

**Answer: Typing text into an input field without leaving it.**

Q) How does the Event object for the change event differ from the Event object for the input event?

- The change event has more properties than the input event.
- The change event uses a custom implementation of the Event object.
- The input event uses a dedicated InputEvent object, while the change event uses the base Event object.
- There is no difference between the two Event objects.

**Answer: The input event uses a dedicated InputEvent object, while the change event uses the base Event object.**
