    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F).</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the chicken thighs with Nando's mild peri-peri sauce, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Ensure the

        <li>Place the marinated chicken on a baking tray and bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the

        <li>While the chicken is baking, peel and cut the potatoes into thick chips.</li>
        <li>Boil the chips in salted water for about 5 minutes, then drain and let them dry.</li>
