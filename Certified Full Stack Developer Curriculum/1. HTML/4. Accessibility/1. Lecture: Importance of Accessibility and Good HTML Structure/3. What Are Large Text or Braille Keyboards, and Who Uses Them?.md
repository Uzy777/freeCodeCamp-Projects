What are Large Text or Braille Keyboards, and Who Uses Them?

Large text and braille keyboards are designed for users with visual disabilities. In Large Text Keyboards, also called Large Print Keyboards, the letters, numbers, and symbols are larger compared to standard keyboards. This design is helpful for people who may find smaller text in the keys difficult to see. Most of them also have enhanced contrast and brightness.

A large print keyboard made by the brand MaxiAids has yellow keys with black, big, and bold letters, numbers, and symbols on them. This is helpful for people with low vision.

Another keyboard is the black large print keyboard with white print on the keys. This keyboard is also backlit, so users can adjust its brightness to different lighting conditions.

While large print keyboards provide visual cues for users with low vision, braille keyboards provide a completely tactile experience for people with more severe vision disabilities, including people who are blind.

Braille is a tactile reading and writing system. It consists of raised dots arranged in specific patterns to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation.

Braille keyboards use this system to help users find the right keys on the keyboard by feeling these patterns with their fingers. The keys have raised dots in patterns that represent letters, numbers and symbols.

And some keyboards combine both approaches- large fonts and braille patterns in the keys. This is helpful for people with visual disabilities and for people who are learning braille.

Large text and braille keyboards are tools that empower people with visual disabilities. By providing alternative input methods, these assistive technologies ensure that everyone can be part of the digital world.
