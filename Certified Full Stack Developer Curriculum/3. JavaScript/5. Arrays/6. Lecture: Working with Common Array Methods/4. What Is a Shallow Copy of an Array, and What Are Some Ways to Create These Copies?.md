A shallow copy of an array is a new array that contains references to the same elements as the original array. Creating shallow copies of arrays is a common operation, especially when you want to manipulate an array without modifying the original.

There are several methods for creating shallow copies of arrays, and we'll explore some of the most common ones: `concat()`, `slice()`, and the spread operator.

Let's start with the `concat()` method. This method creates a new array by merging two or more arrays. When used with a single array, it effectively creates a shallow copy. Here's an example:

```js
let originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
let copyArray = [].concat(originalArray);

console.log(copyArray); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(copyArray === originalArray); // false
```

In this example, we are using the `concat()` method to concatenate an empty array to the `originalArray`. This will create a new array that is a shallow copy of `originalArray`.

The `copyArray` contains the same elements as `originalArray`, but it is a different array object, which is why the strict equality check (`===`) returns `false`.

Another method to create a shallow copy is the `slice()` method. When called without arguments, `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the entire array. Here's how it works:

```js
let originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
let copyArray = originalArray.slice();

console.log(copyArray); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(copyArray === originalArray); // false
```

In this case, `originalArray.slice()` creates a new array that is a shallow copy of `originalArray`. Again, the `copyArray` contains the same elements but is a different array object.

The spread operator (`...`), introduced in ES6, provides another concise way to create shallow copies of arrays. Here's an example:

```js
let originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
let copyArray = [...originalArray];

console.log(copyArray); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(copyArray === originalArray); // false
```

The spread operator (`...`) spreads the elements of `originalArray` into a new array, effectively creating a shallow copy. It's important to note that all these methods create new array objects, which means you can modify the copy without affecting the original array. For example:

```js
let originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
let copyArray = [...originalArray];

copyArray.push(4);
console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(copyArray);     // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

In this example, adding an element to `copyArray` doesn't affect `originalArray`.

In summary, shallow copies of arrays can be easily created using methods like `concat()`, `slice()`, or the spread operator. These methods are useful for creating new arrays that can be manipulated independently of the original array.
