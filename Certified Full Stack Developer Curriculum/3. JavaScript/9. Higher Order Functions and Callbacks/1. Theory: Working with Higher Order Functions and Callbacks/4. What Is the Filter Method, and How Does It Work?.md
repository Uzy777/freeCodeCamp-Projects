The `filter` method is used to create a new array with elements that pass a specified test, making it useful for selectively extracting items based on criteria.

In this example, we are using the `filter` method, to create a new array of only even numbers:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this example, the `filter` method applies a callback function to each element of the `numbers` array. The callback checks whether each number is even using the modulo operator (`%`).

If the number is even, the function returns `true`, and that number is included in the new array. If it's odd, the function returns `false`, and that number is excluded.

Just like the `map` method, the callback function for the `filter` method accepts the same three arguments: the current element being processed, the index, and the array.

It's important to note that if no elements pass the test, the `filter` method returns an empty array.

```js
const numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8].filter((num) => num > 10);

console.log(numbers); // []
```

`filter` is incredibly versatile and can be used in many scenarios. You can use it to remove `null` or `undefined` values from an array, to filter objects based on their properties, or to implement search functionality.

Here's an example of using the `filter` method to return an array of objects for individuals younger than `30` years old.

```javascript
const developers = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 35 },
  { name: "David", age: 25 }
];

const youngPeople = developers.filter((person) => person.age < 30);
console.log(youngPeople);

// [{ name: "Alice", age: 25 }, { name: "David", age: 25 }]
```

Throughout the rest of this curriculum, you will be using the `map` and `filter` methods very frequently. So, building familiarity with them will not only streamline your coding process but also help you write cleaner and more efficient code.
