The optional chaining operator (`?.`) is a useful tool in JavaScript that lets you safely access object properties or call methods without worrying whether they exist. It's like a safety net for working with objects that might have missing parts.

```js
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30
};

console.log(person.name); // "Alice"
console.log(person.job); // undefined
```

In this example, `person.name exists`, so it logs `Alice`. But `person.job` doesn't exist, so it gives us `undefined`.

Now, let's say we want to access a property of an object that might not exist:

```js
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30
};

console.log(person.address.street); // This will throw an error!
```

This example will throw an `Uncaught TypeError`. Since `person.address` is `undefined`, we are not able to access the `street` property. This is where the optional chaining operator comes in handy. Here is an example of using the optional chaining operator:

```js
const user = {
  name: "John",
  profile: {
    email: "john@example.com",
    address: {
      street: "123 Main St",
      city: "Somewhere"
    }
  }
};

console.log(user.profile?.address?.street); // "123 Main St"
console.log(user.profile?.phone?.number);   // undefined
```

By using the optional chaining operator, we are telling JavaScript to only continue with the operation if the object (or the value before the `?.`) exists and is not `null` or `undefined`.

If the value before the `?.` is `null` or `undefined`, JavaScript returns `undefined` rather than attempting to proceed with the operation and throwing an error.

Remember, the optional chaining operator is most useful when you're not sure if a property or method exists. It helps prevent errors and makes your code more robust.
