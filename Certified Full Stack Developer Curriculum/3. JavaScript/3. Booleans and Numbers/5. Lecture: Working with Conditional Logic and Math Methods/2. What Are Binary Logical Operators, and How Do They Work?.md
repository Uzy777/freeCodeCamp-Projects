Binary logical operators help you evaluate two expressions and return a result based on their truthiness. Let's look at the three most common binary logical operators: logical AND, logical OR, and the nullish coalescing operator.

The logical AND operator is represented by a double ampersand (`&&`). It checks if both operands are true and returns a result. If both operands are truthy, it returns the second value, that is, the one on the right:

```js
const result = true && 'hello';

console.log(result); // hello
```

In the example above, the text `hello` is logged to the console because both operands are `true`. If either operand is falsy, it returns the falsy value:

```js
const result = 0 && 3;

console.log(result); // 0
```

Since `0` is a falsy value, the number `0` is logged to the console. And if both operands are falsy, it returns the first falsy value:

```js
const result = false && 0;

console.log(result); // false
```

Since `false` is a falsy value, then `false` is logged to the console. The logical AND operator is useful when you want to check multiple conditions and ensure that all are true before proceeding. Here is an example:

```js
if (2 < 3 && 3 < 4) {
 console.log('The if block runs'); 
} else {
 console.log('The else block runs');
}
```

In the condition, since `2` is less than `3` AND `3` is less than `4`, then the sentence `The if block runs` will be logged to the console.

The logical OR operator checks if at least one of the operands is truthy.If the first operand is truthy, it returns that value:

```js
const result = 'This is truthy' || false;

console.log(result); // This is truthy
```

If the first operand is falsy but the second is truthy, the second value will be logged to the console:

```js
const result = 0 || 'This is truthy';

console.log(result); // This is truthy
```

It is common to use the logical OR operator in `if/else` statements like this:

```js
let userInput;

if (userInput || 'Guest') {
 console.log('A user is present');
} else {
 console.log('No user detected');
}
```

Since we didn't assign a value to the `userInput` variable, it is currently `undefined`. The condition in the `if` statement checks if either the `userInput` variable or the string `Guest` are truthy. Since the string `Guest` is true in a boolean context like this, the string `A user is present` will be logged to the console.

The nullish coalescing operator is more sophisticated than logical OR and logical AND.Represented by a double question mark (`??`), it helps in scenarios where you want to return a value only if the first one is `null` or `undefined`. Here is an example of working with the nullish coalescing operator:

```js
const result = null ?? 'default';

console.log(result); // default
```

Since `null` is a falsy value, the string `default` would be logged to the console. The nullish coalescing operator is incredibly useful in situations where `null` or `undefined` are the only values that should trigger a fallback or default value. Here is an example of dealing with a user's preference settings:

```js
const userSettings = {
 theme: null,
 volume: 0,
 notifications: false,
};

let theme = userSettings.theme ?? 'light';
console.log(theme); // light
```

In the example above, we have an object called `userSettings` that contains `theme`, `volume` and `notifications` properties. We are accessing the `theme` using dot notation like `userSettings.theme`. You will learn more about how to work with objects in a future lecture. Since the user's `theme` is currently set to `null`, then the string `light` will be logged to the console.
