What is overflow in CSS, and how does it work?

Overflow refers to the way elements handle content that exceeds or overflows the size of the containing element. For example, the text content of a `div` element can overflow out of its borders.

Overflow is two-dimensional, the x-axis determines horizontal overflow, and the y-axis determines vertical overflow.

Let's fix the overflow on our example using the `overflow-y` CSS property. First we can hide the overflow entirely with `hidden` like this:

```css
div {
  overflow-y: hidden;
}
```

TThis resolves the overflow problem but now the extra content becomes completely unreachable. Instead we can use scroll to force the element to become scrollable:

```css
div {
  overflow-y: scroll;
}
```

Now this turns the container into a scrollable element, allowing all the content to be viewed by scrolling the element independently of the page scroll. We could also let the browser handle it on its own with `auto` value. It's worth noting that vertical scrolling is generally considered okay while horizontal scrolling might be questioned as it's generally not a common design decision.

With this knowledge, you can now control how your content overflows giving you more power over the layout of your pages.
