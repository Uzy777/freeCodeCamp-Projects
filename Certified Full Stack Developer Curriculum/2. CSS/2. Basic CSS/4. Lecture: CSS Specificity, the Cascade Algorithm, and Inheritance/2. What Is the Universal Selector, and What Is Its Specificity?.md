What is the universal selector and what is its specificity?

The universal selector (`*`) is a special type of CSS selector that matches any element in the document.

It is often used to apply a style to all elements on the page, which can be useful for resetting or normalizing styles across different browsers.

The universal selector can be used to select all elements within a specific context or globally across the entire document.

Here is an example of using the universal selector for setting the `margin` and `padding` for the entire HTML document:

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

In this code example, the `*` selector resets the margin and padding of all elements to zero, which is a common technique used in CSS resets.

The universal selector has the lowest specificity value of any selector. It contributes 0 to all parts of the specificity value `(0, 0, 0, 0)`.

This means that any other selector, including type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and inline styles, will override the styles set by the universal selector.

Let's take a look at the following HTML and CSS example:

```html
<head>
  <style>
    * {
      color: blue;
    }
    p {
      color: red;
    }
    .highlight {
      color: green;
    }
    #unique {
      color: purple;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p id="unique" class="highlight">This text has multiple styles applied.</p>
</body>
```

The universal `*` selector sets the text color to `blue` for all elements.

However, the `p` type selector overrides this by setting the text color to `red` specifically for `p` elements.

If an element has the `highlight` class, the class selector takes precedence, changing the text color to `green`.

Finally, the `#unique` ID selector, which has the highest specificity, will override all others, setting the text color to `purple`.
