## Transcript
Let's learn about some of the common issues when trying to style special input elements like the `datetime-local` and `color` inputs.

These special types of inputs rely on complex pseudo-elements to create things like the date and color pickers. This presents a significant challenge for styling these inputs. One challenge is that the default styling is entirely browser-dependent, so the CSS you write to make the picker look the way intend may be entirely different on another browser.

Another may be the complexity of the pseudo-element. Consider the date selector; there are a lot of moving parts here and the complex structure of the pseudo-element might pose a significant challenge in applying styling to the right areas.

Of course, with these complex elements, you also run the risk of accidentally losing important functionality when you manually style them. Not only could you lose important indicators like the focus state or selected item but you could potentially break the selector entirely.

For these reasons many developers rely on JavaScript libraries or custom components entirely instead of using the browser's built-in components.
