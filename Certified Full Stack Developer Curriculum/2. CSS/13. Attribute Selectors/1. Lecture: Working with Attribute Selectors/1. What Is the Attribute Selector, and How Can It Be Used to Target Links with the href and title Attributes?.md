What is the attribute selector, and how can it be used to target links with the `href` and `title` attribute?

The attribute selector in CSS is a powerful tool that allows you to target HTML elements based on their attributes. This means you can apply styles to elements that have specific attributes or even certain values for those attributes.

It's particularly useful when you want to style elements dynamically or when class names alone don't provide enough specificity.

For example, you can use the attribute selector to target all links that have an `href` attribute. This is especially handy when you want to apply a uniform style to all links on a page.

Here's how you can use the attribute selector to target links with the `href` attribute:

```css
a[href] {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

This CSS rule will apply a blue color and an underline to any link that includes an `href` attribute, ensuring that all clickable links are styled consistently.

But attribute selectors can be more specific. Suppose you want to target only the links that have a `title` attribute. The `title` attribute often provides additional information about the link, and you might want to style these links differently to indicate that they have extra information available. Here's how you can do it:

```css
a[title] {
  font-weight: bold;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

This rule applies bold text and removes the underline from any link with a `title` attribute. It's a great way to visually differentiate these links from others on the page.

You can also combine attribute selectors to get even more precise. For example, if you want to style links that have both `href` and `title` attributes, you can do this:

```css
a[href][title] {
  color: green;
}
```

In this case, only links that contain both `href` and `title` attributes will be styled with green text. This level of control is what makes attribute selectors so powerful in CSS.

Using attribute selectors not only enhances the styling of your webpage but also improves accessibility by making interactive elements like links more distinguishable based on their attributes.
