How to use the attribute selector to target ordered list elements with the `type` attribute?

When working with ordered lists in HTML, the `type` attribute allows you to specify the style of numbering used, such as numerical, alphabetical, or Roman numerals.

The `type` attribute can be set on an `ol` (ordered list) element to control the numbering format:

*   `1` for numerical lists (such as 1, 2, 3, ...),
    
*   `A` for uppercase alphabetical lists (such as A, B, C, ...),
    
*   `a` for lowercase alphabetical lists (such as a, b, c, ...),
    
*   `I` for uppercase Roman numerals (such as I, II, III, ...),
    
*   `i` for lowercase Roman numerals (such as i, ii, iii, ...).
    

Here's how you can use the attribute selector to target an ordered list with a specific `type` attribute:

```css
ol[type="A"] {
  color: purple;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

In this example, the CSS rule will apply purple text and bold font weight to any ordered list that uses uppercase alphabetical numbering, which is specified by `type="A"`.

Similarly, you can target ordered lists that use lowercase Roman numerals by selecting those with `type="i"`:

```css
ol[type="i"] {
  color: green;
}
```

This rule will change the text color to green for any ordered list that uses lowercase Roman numerals.

The ability to style ordered lists based on their `type` attribute gives you greater control over the appearance of lists in your document, allowing for customization based on how content is structured.
