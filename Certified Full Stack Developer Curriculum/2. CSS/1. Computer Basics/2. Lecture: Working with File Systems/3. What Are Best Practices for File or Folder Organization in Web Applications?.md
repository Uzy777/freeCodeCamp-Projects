What are best practices for file and folder organization in web applications?

When building out web applications, it is important to think about the organization of your files and folders. This will help keep your code organized and easier to maintain.

Let's take a look at an example folder structure for an HTML and CSS project:

```bash
.
├── /assets
│   ├── /images
│   │   ├── logo.png
│   │   ├── banner.jpg
│   │   └── icons.svg
│   ├── /fonts
│   │   ├── custom-font.woff
│   │   └── custom-font.woff2
├── /css
│   ├── main.css
│   ├── about.css
│   └── contact.css
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── contact.html
└── README.md
```

At the top of the example, there is a single dot, which represents the root directory.

The root directory is the top-level directory in a file system, serving as the starting point for all file paths and containing all other directories and files. A directory is another name for a folder.

Inside the root directory, the first directory shown is the `assets` directory. The term `assets` refers to any files that are used in the project, such as images, fonts, or other resources.

In this example, there are two directories inside the `assets` directory called `images` and `fonts`.

The next directory would be the `css` directory. Sometimes this is also referred to as a stylesheets directory. This is where you would store all of your CSS files.

Below the `css` directory are the HTML files. The `index.html` file represents the homepage, while `about.html` and `contact.html` represent the About and Contact pages, respectively.

Lastly, there is a `README.md` file. `README` files are commonly used to provide useful information about the project, such as what it does, how to use it, and any other relevant details.

The `.md` extension stands for Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language that is often used to write documentation.

By organizing your project into assets, CSS, and HTML files, it makes it easy to find what you are looking for. This also makes it easy for other developers to contribute to your project.

It is important to note that this is just one example of how you can organize your files and folders. There are many different ways to structure a project.
