What are safe ways to sign into your computer?

Many of you have being using computers for a while. But you might not have thought about the safest or most secure ways to sign into your computer.

Whether you are using a Mac or PC, there are many ways to safely sign into your computer.

The first thing you should do is to make sure that your computer is password protected.

For Windows users, start by opening the Start menu and selecting Settings. From there, go to Accounts and then Sign-in options. You can then set up a password for your computer.

Note: If you encounter any difficulties or are using a different version of Windows, refer to the official Microsoft documentation or support resources for detailed instructions tailored to your specific version.

When creating your password, make sure it is a long and complex password. You can use a combination of letters, numbers and special characters to make it more secure.

Choosing an easy password like `12345` or `password` is not a good idea. These are easy to guess and can be easily hacked.

Also, do not use passwords based on personal information like your name, birthday, or address. Those are also easy for hackers to guess.

When you create your password, it is also a good idea to setup two-factor authentication (2FA). 2FA serves as an extra layer of security and requires a second form of verification to ensure that the person trying to access the account is indeed the authorized user.

If you are a Mac user, you can click on the Apple menu and then go to system settings. From there you can go to Users & Groups and set up a password for your computer.

Some Mac computers come with a touch ID feature, which is often considered more secure than regular passwords. This feature allows you to sign into your computer using your fingerprint.

For Windows users, the Windows Hello feature offers a more secure way to sign in. It uses biometric methods such as facial recognition or fingerprints for authentication, providing an alternative to traditional passwords.

After you finish watching these set of lecture videos, I urge you to look into these additional security features and set them up on your computer so that you can keep your computer safe and secure.
