What are some best practices for working with typography in your designs?

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to communicate effectively. It involves formatting text and selecting appropriate fonts. In this lecture, you will learn best practices for using typography in a way that enhances readability, hierarchy, and accessibility.

Let's start with readability. You should choose clear and simple fonts to make your designs easy to understand. This is particularly important for the main text of your website. Users are more likely to engage with your content if the font is easy to read. Some frequently used fonts for web development are Roboto, Open Sans, Poppins, Lato, and Barlow. But there are many to choose from and you will definitely find one that fits your needs.

Text should also be large enough for everyone to read it. You should try to keep lines relatively short. The specific number of characters per line really depends on your project. But keeping lines short will make the content easier to read.

You can use font size to create a visual hierarchy for headings, subheadings, paragraphs, and other elements. For example, the main heading on a webpage should have a larger font, followed by subheadings with smaller font sizes. This will give every element in the hierarchy a specific font size that helps users navigate through the structure visually.

You should use two or three fonts at most to create a visual consistency. Using too many fonts can make the text more difficult to read and weaken your branding's identity. This can also impact the user experience by increasing the load time of the website.

Once you choose these two or three fonts, use them consistently across different pages and elements. These fonts should be consistent with the overall design of your web application, product, or service. You should also use whitespace to create a visual balance and enhance readability.

For accessibility purposes, you should follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These guidelines set the recommended contrast ratio for text. A higher contrast ratio makes text easier to read, especially for people with visual disabilities.

You should also provide options to adjust font size and avoid complex fonts as much as possible. As a general rule, you should use simple fonts whenever possible. If your content is easy to read, users are more likely to engage with it. A final tip for working with typography is making sure that your fonts are displayed correctly on different screen sizes and devices.

Typography is a powerful tool for creating beautiful designs and engaging user experiences. By understanding the fundamentals of typography and applying these best practices, you can create effective designs.
