What is the `minmax()` function, and how does it work?

The `minmax()` function defines the range for the size of a grid track, specifying how much space a row or column can occupy.

Remember that you can set the track size with units like `px` (pixels), `rem`, or even `em`, and with fractional units (`fr`).

The `minmax()` function takes things a bit further by allowing you to set a minimum size and a maximum size for the grid track.

Here's the syntax of the `minmax()` function:

```css
minmax(min, max)
```

`min` is the minimum size of the grid track, which can be set using pixels, percentage, or `auto`. And `max` is the maximum size of the grid track which you can set with the same units.

The two values work together this way:

*   The `min` value ensures the grid track will never shrink below a set size.
    
*   The `max` value limits how large the grid track can grow.
    

The grid track size adjusts dynamically between the `min` and `max` values based on content and container size.

Let's look at a practical example with this HTML:

```html
<div class="grid-container">
  <div>
    <h2>Item 1</h2>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Item 2</h2>
  </div>
</div>
```

And the grid CSS:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: minmax(150px, 300px) 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
}

.grid-container > div {
  background: crimson;
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

What's happening here?

The first `column, minmax(150px, 300px)`, will always be at least `150px` and at most `300px`, depending on the available space.

On the other other hand, the second column, `1fr`, will take up any available remaining space in the grid container since there are no additional columns to share the space with.

The advantage of the `minmax()` function over fixed sizes and even `fr` units is that it is more flexible, making it ideal for adaptability and responsiveness.

*Q2) Which of the following best describes how the grid track size behaves when using the minmax() function?*

A) The grid track size is fixed between the minimum and maximum values.  
B) The grid track size adjusts dynamically between the min and max values based on content and container size.  
C) The grid track size will always be set to the maximum value, regardless of content.  
D) The grid track size only responds to content, not container size.

> **B) The grid track size adjusts dynamically between the min and max values based on content and container size.**

*Q3) What does the min and max value in the minmax() function control?*

A) The min value allows shrinking, and the max value sets a fixed size.  
B) The min value ensures the grid track won't shrink below a set size, and the max value limits how large it can grow.  
C) The min value limits growth, and the max value determines the smallest size.  
D) Both values set fixed sizes for the grid track.
