## Determining the Winner of Each Round

### Instructions

### Criteria for Player to Win:
- If the player chooses "Rock" and the computer chooses "Scissors"
- If the player chooses "Scissors" and the computer chooses "Paper"
- If the player chooses "Paper" and the computer chooses "Rock"

A few function calls have been provided for you to test your function.
